### Hi, I am Peng Chen. ðŸ‘‹ 

## About

I am a senior R&D engineer in the Distributed Streaming Media Architecture team at Alibaba Cloud. I received my master degree from Kyoto University in 2020, supervised by Prof. [Adam Jatowt](https://adammo12.github.io/adamjatowt/). During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to explore and implement a [distributed machine learning system](https://github.com/Natureal/Distribution_intern) under the supervision of Dr. [Bin Tong](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37532385600) at Hitachi Central Research Lab(Tokyo). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Soochow University in 2017, where I spent about three wonderful years training for *ACM-ICPC* algorithm competition.

My research interests includes Distributed Systems, Machine Learning Systems, Cloud Computing, Algorithm and Data Structures.

## Experience
Full-time Job: Alibaba Cloud, Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, Apr. 2020 -- Present  
Team: Distributed Streaming Media Architecture, Department of Video Cloud Technology  
I currently hold the position of Senior R\&D Engineer. Our team is responsible for building and maintaining  [GRTN(Global Real-time Transport Network)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RNLI1nAbXcXOx-x2rVTLWQ), a large distributed streaming server for Alibab Group's live video streaming and video conferencing based on large-scale CDN network and edge computing nodes, which carries Taobao live streaming within the group, and also serves Douyin/TikTok, Kuaishou, CCTV live streaming businesses externally. I am responsible for the development and upgrade of the GRTN base within the team, while participating in the pre-research and implementation of next-generation low-latency live streaming and video conferencing technology solutions, as well as co-creating academic papers with research interns in the group.


ML-System Intern: Hitachi Central Laboratory, Department of Media Intelligence, Tokyo, Aug. -- Nov. 2018  
Topic: Distributed ML system development with high concurrency. Advisor: Dr. Bin Tong (Now Alibaba Senior Algorithm Expert)  
I explored and implemented a highly concurrent training and prediction system for two different image classification machine learning algorithm models called Few-Shot learning based model and XGBoost. The system has two key capabilities:

Distributed training with multiple GPUs/nodes.

Inference with scalability.

In particular, we built a Kubernetes-based physical cluster, and built a Spark-based logical cluster on top of it, then encapsulated the algorithm models into Docker for deployment. Finally, we implemented an experimental distributed image classification system and simulated real-time queries using streaming data sources for pressure testing to validate the high concurrency performance of image classification.
