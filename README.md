### Hi, I am Peng Chen. ðŸ‘‹ 

## About

I am a senior R&D engineer in the Distributed Streaming Media Architecture team at Alibaba Cloud. I received my master degree from Kyoto University in 2020, supervised by Prof. [Adam Jatowt](https://adammo12.github.io/adamjatowt/). During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to explore and implement a [distributed machine learning system](https://github.com/Natureal/Distribution_intern) under the supervision of Dr. [Bin Tong](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37532385600) at Hitachi Central Research Lab (Tokyo). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Soochow University in 2017, where I spent about three wonderful years training for *ACM-ICPC* algorithm competition.

My research interests includes Distributed Systems, Machine Learning Systems, Cloud Computing, Algorithm and Advanced Data Structures.
