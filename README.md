### Hi, I am Peng Chen. ðŸ‘‹ 

### Bio

I am a senior R&D engineer in the Distributed Streaming Media Architecture team at Alibaba Cloud. Currently working on papers with research interns in our group. I have extensive experience in computer networks, distributed systems, and machine learning. Algorithmic design is also very appealing to me, I have competed in algorithmic competitions(acm-icpc) for 4 years.

My research interests include Distributed Systems, ML, Cloud Computing, Algo \& Advanced Data Structures.
